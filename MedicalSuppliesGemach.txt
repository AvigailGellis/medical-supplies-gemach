I run an organization that lends out medical supplies to people in need on a short term basis and I need a system to keep everything organized. 
I need each borrower's name and phone number.
I need to know when each item was picked up and when it was returned.
I also want to keep track of the condition of each item when they were borrowed and returned.

I need the following reports:

How many times each item was borrowed, ordered by most often to least often.
A list of all items sorted by the condition they're currently in.
I want to know the average amount of days items have been borrowed for. 
I also want to know the longest and shortest amount of time an item has been borrowed for.
For items that haven't been returned yet, how long has it been since they were borrowed?
I want to know how many people gave donations and how many declined.

Questions:
1. Do you have a limit on how long the items can be lent out for?
No.

2. Can someone borrow more than one item at a time?
It doesn't usually happen.

3. Do you need to record the time that the items were borrowed and returned?
No, the date is enough.

4. Do you charge money for this service?
No, but when the items are returned we do ask for a donation, which most people are happy to give. We don't need to record the amounts (we do that in a different system), I just need to know if a donation was made or not.

Sample data:

Name, Phone Number, Item Name, Date Borrowed, Condition Borrowed, Date Returned, Condition Returned, Donation?
